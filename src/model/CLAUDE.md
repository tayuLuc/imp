# src/model - loaders, architectures, weight upload

GGUF and SafeTensors loading, the architecture registry, tensor-name mapping, upload and placement.

## Invariants

- Architecture registry = `model_arch.h` + `arch_registry.cpp`, the one table of GGUF / HF class / HF model_type spellings (#2457). A new arch needs both, a `kArchRegistry` row in `model.cpp`, a `tests/test_model_profile_table.cpp` row and a chat template. Phi (`PhiForCausalLM`, `Phi3ForCausalLM`) maps onto `LLAMA` there, no own arch.
- A checkpoint this build cannot serve is refused at load, never loaded and served wrong (#1403).
- A drop predicate and the function that executes it see the same condition (#1384, #1403).
- Tensor names are translated in one place: two translation paths that disagree discard whole towers.
- A checkpoint is untrusted input, including the counts it states about itself. Anything reaching a `resize`, a recursion or an `open()` needs a bound from `model_limits.h` (declared count: refuse; index parsed out of a name: drop) (#1611).

## Entry points

- `model_arch.h`: the architecture enum
- `arch_registry.cpp`: checkpoint spelling -> `ModelArch`, read by `parse_model_arch` and the HF loader
- `model.cpp`: per-arch config and sampling defaults, KV-FP8 safety lists
- `gguf_loader.cpp` / `safetensors_loader.cpp`: the two formats
- `hf_config_loader.cpp`: `config.json` arch detection + `load_config`; arch-independent keys in `hf_config_generic.cpp`, per-arch keys in `hf_config/<arch>.cpp`, one `kHfConfigHooks` row each in `arch_registry.cpp` (#2537)
- `weight_map.cpp`, `tensor_kind_matcher.cpp`: tensor name -> role
- `weight_upload.cpp`: device placement, expert offload decisions
- `ngram_table.cpp` / `ngram_table_io.cpp`: Qwen4Exp PLE n-gram table. `mmap` maps the shard file and
  leaves residency to the page cache; `pread`/`uring` (`ple.table_backend`, set at load through
  process_diag) read the selected rows into host staging. The open accessors, the `mmap` gather and the
  backend switch live in the first, the streaming readers in the second.
- `expert_placement.h`: the pure predicate for a servable MoE placement

## Test

`make test-vision`: the only lane that puts image bytes through a real checkpoint. Model-level e2e runs against the `make build` image, not `make dev`. Lane rules: `tests/CLAUDE.md`.

## Pitfalls

- Cost a loader task from the checkpoint (`config.json`, tensor names), not from its model category.
- The failure mode here is a silently skipped tensor: count assigned vs total, refuse on a shortfall.
- `IMP_LOG_DEBUG` is invisible at the default log level: a skip reported only there is not reported.
